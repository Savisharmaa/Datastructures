        "**Ques. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is a programming method based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ques. What is a class in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** A class is like a template for creating objects. It defines:\n",
        "1. Attributes\n",
        "2. Methods\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ques. What is an object in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** An object is an instance of a class. When you create an object, you’re making a specific example based on the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ques. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.**Abstraction hides complexity while encapsulation hides internal data.\n",
        "Abstraction interact by showing only necessary thing, while encapsulation protect data and only allow modification through methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ques. What are dunder methods in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** Dunder methods are special methods in Python that have double underscores before and after their names, like __init__ or __str__.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ques. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** Inheritance allows a class (called a child class or subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (called a parent class or superclass). We don’t have to rewrite code, the child class reuses code from the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ques. What is polymorphism in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        " **Ans** Polymorphism allows the same method name or operator to behave differently depending on the object that is using it. It enables objects of different classes to be treated as if they are of the same base class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ques. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** Encapsulation is achieved using classes and access modifiers.\n",
        "Getter and setters are used to control access the private data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "class Student:\n",
        "   \n",
        "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
        "   \n",
        "        self.__name = name\n",
        "        \n",
        "s = Student(\"ABC\")\n",
        "\n",
        "print(s._Student__name)  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Ques. What is a constructor in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** In Python, a constructor is a special method that is automatically called when an object is created from a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ques What are class and static methods in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** Class works with the class itself, not the instance and static doesn't take self or cls as first parameter.Class can be used to access or modify data, static belongs to the class that doesnn't access instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ques. What is method overloading in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** Method overloading means defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ques. What is method overriding in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** Method overriding happens when a child class defines a method with the same name as a method in its parent class, but with a different (or same) behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ques. What is a property decorator in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** The property decorator in Python allows us define a method that can be accessed like an attribute — without parentheses — while still allowing you to add logic (like validation or computation).\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "class Person:\n",
        "    \n",
        "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
        "        self._name = name  \n",
        "\n",
        "    @property\n",
        "    def name(self):\n",
        "        return self._name\n",
        "\n",
        "p = Person(\"ABC\")\n",
        "\n",
        "print(p.name)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ques. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** In polymorphism, one function can work with many types. we don't have to write code again.\n",
        "\n",
        "There is flexibility to add new classes without changing old.\n",
        "\n",
        "It helps to maintain large system.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ques. What is an abstract class in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. It's meant to be inherited by other classes that implement its abstract methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ques. What are the advantages of OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** It is easier to manage and debug.\n",
        "\n",
        "It protects data and writes code which works with multiple type.\n",
        "\n",
        "It hides complexity and easier to maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ques. What is multiple inheritance in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** Multiple inheritance is when a class inherits from two or more parent classes, combining their attributes and methods into a single child class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Syntax:\n",
        "\n",
        " class Parent1:\n",
        "\n",
        "   #methods\n",
        "\n",
        " class Parent2:\n",
        "\n",
        "   #methods\n",
        "\n",
        "  class child(Parent1,Parent2)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ques. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** Class variable is shared by all instance of the class and instance variable is different for each instance. class variable is defined inside the class, outside the method and instance variable is defined inside __init__ method. class variable stores the common data and instance variable stores specific data\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ques. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** __str__ and __repr__ are dunder methods. __str__ is called by the built-in print() function and str(). __str__ is called by repr() or when you enter an object in the interpreter. __str__ returns a string that is easy to read and __repr__ returns a string that could be used to recreate the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ques. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** The super() function is used to call methods from a parent (or superclass) from within a subclass.\n",
        "It allows us to reuse parent class methods without hardcoding the class name. It is more compatible with multiple inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ques. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** The __del__ method in Python is known as a destructor. It is a special method that is called when an object is about to be destroyed, typically when it is no longer in use and about to be garbage collected.\n",
        "\n",
        "** Ques. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** Static method is used when the method does not need to know anything about the class or instance. It's just a function inside a class for organizational purposes.\n",
        "Class method is used when the method needs to know about the class itself — typically for factory methods or operations that affect the class as a whole.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ques. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** In the context of inheritance, polymorphism allows subclasses to override methods of a parent class and still be used interchangeably with the parent.\n",
        "\n",
        "Step 1: Create a base (parent) class with a method\n",
        "\n",
        "Step 2: Subclasses override the method\n",
        "\n",
        "Step 3: Use base class references to call the overridden methods\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        return \"Some sound\"\n",
        "\n",
        "class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        return \"Woof!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "class Cat(Animal):\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        return \"Meow!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "animals = [Dog(), Cat(), Animal()]\n",
        "\n",
        "for animal in animals:\n",
        "    print(animal.speak())\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ques. What is method chaining in Python OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** Method chaining is a technique where multiple methods are called in a single line, one after the other, on the same object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each method returns the object itself (self), allowing the next method to be called on it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Syntax:\n",
        "\n",
        "object.method1().method2().method3()\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ques. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.** The __call__ method in Python is a dunder methods that allows objects to be called like functions. When you write object(), Python looks for the object's __call__() method.\n",
        "\n",
